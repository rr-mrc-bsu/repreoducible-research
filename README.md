# A Living Reproducible Research Compendium


This is an interactive, 'living', bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) 
project to build a hands-on resource
for pragmatic solutions to reproducibility related issues in biostatistics.
The book itself acts a learning-by-doing example for its contributors and should 
be considered permanent WIP.

We automatically deploy the last master commit of the book to 
https://rr-mrc-bsu.github.io/reproducible-research/ - 
feel free to browse or download as .pdf/.epub!
